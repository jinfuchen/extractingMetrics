The contents of the cloc/Unix/ directory are intended for 
cloc package maintainers on distributions such as Ubuntu,
Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Mint, SUSE, FreeBSD, Mac OSX.  It
contains a version of cloc that is stripped of the 
Rexexp::Common and Algorithm::Diff code and instead relies
on the package definition to require these--as well as
Digest::MD5--as dependencies.

Also included is Perl "POD" documentation that can be used
to create a man page:
  pod2man cloc.1.pod > cloc.1
